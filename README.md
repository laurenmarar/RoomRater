### Problem statement

At the start of the COVID pandemic, professionals found themselves suddenly launched into a work-from-home situation, requireing that they attend meetings from their kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, and if they're lucky, home offices.

Many people were not used to presenting themselves in this context, and are even less aware of how their bacgrounds were a part of the impression they gave. 

Enter RoomRater. This Twitter account begain posting photos of various people appearning on air, particularly reporters. They began scoring people's backgrounds, applauding them for a good use of plants and books in the background, or critiquing their lighighting situation.
